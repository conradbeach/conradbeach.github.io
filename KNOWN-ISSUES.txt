-In Firefox, the profile pic on my homepage disappears at smaller screen sizes.
-Social icons in IE look pixelated.
-Text for homepage's call to action is poorly aligned at certain screen sizes.
-In Safari, the profile pic on the homepage doesn't float to the center when the layout switches to one column.
-In Safari, around 1000px viewport width, the project links on the portfolio page drop below and cover up the bottom <hr>.


Ideas:
-Alter the portfolio page. Make the project links squares with drop shadows like the image on the drummingexpert project page.

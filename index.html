                <h3>Being Good</h3>
                <p>I care a lot about being a genuinely good person and treating people right. I strive to be kind, generous and ethical in everything I do. Being humble and selfless is important to me. I want to be the kind of person who's easy and enriching to work with, the kind of guy that you're really grateful to have on your team.</p>

                <h3>Doing Good</h3>
                <p>I'm passionate about doing work that makes a positive difference in the world. It doesn't need to be as glamorous as curing cancer or something like that, but it does need to be genuinely valuable. It needs to solve real problems and make people's lives better. Too many businesses, teams, etc. really only exist to make money; I think that's a shame, and I think we can do better.</p>

                <p>I'm committed to the constant pursuit of mastering
                my field of work. I've chosen software development as my career,
                and I intend to become the best I possibly can at it. I'm always
                working to learn more about what I do and looking for ways to improve.
                I'm definitely not one of the best developers out there and likely
                never will be, but I'm on the path to mastery and I intend to be
                on it for a very long time.</p>

                <h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
                <p>I focus on writing code that works correctly, is reliable and is easy to maintain. I aim to build products that meet needs and are easy and enjoyable to use. I take the time to truly understand problems so that I can create well-designed, quality solutions. Well-made software can do amazing things. Poorly made software can be a real pain. I work hard to consistently produce the well-made kind. I put a lot of effort into keeping my schedule, health and other factors in balance so that I can stay fresh and do my best work.</p>

                <h3>Joy</h3>
                <p>Ultimately, I choose to be a developer because I love doing it! I love writing code; I love creating beautiful, useful software. Building things with nothing more than a laptop and some know-how is a blast. I find joy in it, and I want the work I do to create joy in the lives of others as well.</p>

                <h3>Ruby</h3>
                <p>I fell in love with the Ruby language pretty quickly. I'm a
                huge fan of the elegance of the syntax and it's focus on
                programmer happiness. Writing Ruby feels natural and easy
                while still providing powerful tools and constructs. Most of the
                code I've written so far in my career has been Ruby.</p>

                </a>
                <h3>Rails</h3>
                <p>I think Rails is a fantastic framework for web development. I
                really appreciate the focus on convention over configuration and
                sensible defaults. It also pursues Ruby's goals of emphasizing programmer
                happiness and exalting beautiful code. I'm impressed by how
                productive I can be when I work with Rails. Even having been
                around as long as it has, I'm still excited by the progress and
                additions being made to the framework.</p>

                <h3>REST APIs</h3>
                <p>I really enjoy building REST APIs. I prefer to be on the back-end, and I really
                like when I get to focus on just the data and don't have to worry too
                much about client-side UI. A quality API goes beyond just returning the right data.
                It includes things like semantically correct status codes, helpful error messages,
                predictable URL structures and secure, user-friendly authentication. Whether
                the API is intended to be consumed by an external application or by a companion
                front-end application or both, I really enjoy working with REST APIs.
                (As long as I can use JSON and not XML. <i class="far fa-grin-tongue"></i>)</p>

                </a>
                <h3>Automated Testing</h3>
                <p>I'm a big believer in automated testing. Well tested code is
                easier to work with, easier to depend on and just makes for
                better software. I don't typically practice true TDD, but I
                write tests frequently as I write implementation code. I don't
                think of writing tests as only an investment in the future (though it
                certainly is that); I think writing tests improves the quality of
                your code and your software immediately, and there aren't very
                many cases where you wouldn't want to write tests.</p>

                </a>
                <h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
                <p>I really enjoy managing source code with Git. I think there's a lot of value in not only putting your code under source control, but in taking the time to do it well. I think a well-crafted Git history in a project can be a really valuable resource. It can be helpful to your team (or you) in the future and also improve the quality of your code as you're committing it. It's common for me to write lengthy commit messages and take the time to revise my Git history as I'm working on a project.</p>

                <p><i>2019, Personal Project (WIP)</i></p>
                <p>Temperature Alert is a small API only application that sends
                SMS notifications to users when the temperature in their area
                hits the user's configured alert thresholds.</p>
                <p>For example, I keep my windows open at night during the
                summer to let in the cool night air, and I use Temperature Alert
                to remind me to close the windows once it gets hot
                enough outside.</p>
                <p>The back-end logic for configuring alerts and delivering
                notifications is complete, but the API is not.</p>
                <p>I'm building the application with Rails 6 and testing it with
                RSpec. SMS notifications are delivered via AWS SNS.</p>

                <p><i>2019, <a href="https://journaltech.com/" target="_blank">Journal Technologies</a></i></p>
                <p>Cloud Accounting is an API only application that serves as a
                central storage location for all payment transactions from other
                applications in Journal Technologies' cloud suite.</p>
                <p>Prior to building Cloud Accounting, each individual
                application stored transaction information. By instead storing
                all transactions in a central place, we did complicate the
                implementation for the other applications in some ways because they now had
                an additional dependency to interact with, but we improved the
                security of the financial information and we made life easier
                for the people in accounting because they only had to go to one
                place when they needed any financial data.</p>
                <p>I was primarily responsible for building the application. I
                used Rails to build the REST API, and I used 
                <a href="https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation" target="_blank">rspec_api_documentation</a>
                to document it. I also built an admin interface using thoughtbot
                <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate" target="_blank">Administrate</a>.
                The API was secured using token based
                authentication and the admin interface was secured with
                <a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank">Okta</a> single sign-on.</p>

                <h3>Case Notifications</h3>
                <p><i>2018, <a href="https://journaltech.com/" target="_blank">Journal Technologies</a></i></p>
                <p>Case Notifications is an application that consumes event data
                from courts (a hearing was scheduled, a document was filed,
                etc.) and then summarizes and distributes that event data
                to subscribers through SMS and email notifications.</p>
                <p>I built a RESTful back-end using Rails which integrated with a
                React front-end. I also built a companion AWS Lambda function
                which notified the Case Notifications application when a new
                data file had been uploaded to AWS S3. I also built an admin
                interface using thoughtbot
                <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate" target="_blank">Administrate</a>.
                The user facing application was secured with
                <a href="https://auth0.com/" target="_blank">Auth0</a>, and the admin interface was
                secured with <a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank">Okta</a> single sign-on.<p>
                <p>One of the interesting parts of this project for me was the
                performance optimization required. Some of the courts we
                expected to integrate with could have tens of thousands of events
                a day. I did work that optimized processing and
                importing these large data files which improved the import time for
                10,000 events from about 5 minutes to about 4 seconds.<p>

                <p>I spent my time fixing bugs and adding
                small features. I also found and fixed a number of security
                vulnerabilities. Another teammate and I
                dramatically improved the test coverage of the application.</p>

                <p>This application was built for the MIT Sloan School of
                Management. It syncs student and course data from an
                existing system to Sloan's Canvas LMS instance. Syncing
                primarily happens via scheduled jobs but can also be done 
                through one-off jobs.</p>
                <p>The application makes extensive use of asynchronous
                background jobs for both the one-off and scheduled sync tasks.</p>
                <p>I did full-stack development on the project. Myself and
                another team member built a Rails back-end and a React, Redux
                front-end.</p>
                <p>The front-end is a dashboard that allows administrators to
                see which jobs are running, manage scheduled jobs and
                allows them to execute one-off jobs.</p>

                <p>Konbata is a Ruby gem which converts 
                <a href="https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/" target="_blank">SCORM</a> packages and zipped PDFs into 
                <a href="https://www.instructure.com/canvas/" target="_blank">Canvas LMS</a> courses. It can generate an
                <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/cc/index.html" target="_blank">.imscc file</a>
                (a standard learning management system file type) and also upload that
                .imscc to create a course in a Canvas instance. Konbata was designed 
                to process interactive and non-interactive SCORM packages 
                along with zip archives containing PDF files.</p>
                <p>I wrote the large majority of the code for the gem along with
                creating the documentation.</p>

                packages. It also allows you to upload those converted packages to a Canvas instance.</p>
                <p>At the time, Senkyoshi was a superior alternative to the
                official Canvas converter from Instructure offering better
                conversion of Blackboard content. Perhaps it still is.</p>
                <p>My contributions to this project were limited. I fixed bugs,
                added small additional features and cleaned up the documentation

                <h3>JavaScript SPAs</h3>
                <p>I’ve done quite a bit of JavaScript development in the past,
                and I'm comfortable doing it when I need to, but it's not my
                preference and it's definitely not where I'm strongest.
                I prefer spending most of my time on back-end development; I enjoy
                it more and I feel like I have more natural aptitude
                and value to contribute in that area. If I can work in a stack with
                simple client-side tooling like <a href="https://hotwired.dev/">Hotwire</a>,
                even better.</p>

                <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
                <p>I’m conscious of basic performance requirements and pay attention to the performance of the code I write, but there haven’t been too many projects I’ve worked on thus far where performance was a high priority. I’m not the kind of guy who can eek out every drop of performance from an application. (If I was I probably wouldn’t be using Rails, right? <i class="far fa-grin-tears"></i> I kid, I kid. Rails is great.)</p>

                <p>I don’t have a traditional computer science background and
                heavy computer science topics have never been terribly
                interesting to me. If something requires lots of math,
                sophisticated algorithms or other such things, I don't have a
                lot of supporting skills to offer.</p>

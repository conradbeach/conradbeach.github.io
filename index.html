                <h3>Being Good</h3>
                <p>I care a lot about being a genuinely good person and treating people right. I strive to be kind, generous and ethical in everything I do. I want to be the kind of person who's easy and enriching to work with, the kind of guy that you're really grateful to have on your team.</p>

                <h3>Doing Good</h3>
                <p>I'm passionate about doing work that makes a positive difference in the world. It doesn't need to be as glamorous as curing cancer or something like that, but it does need to be genuinely valuable. It needs to solve real problems and make people's lives better. Too many businesses, teams, etc. really only exist to make money; I think that's a shame, and I think we can do better.</p>

                <h3>Constant Improvement</h3>
                <p>I'm genuinely committed to the constant pursuit of mastering
                my field of work. I've chosen software development as my career, and I intend to become the best I possibly can at it. I don't want to be a halfway decent developer; I want to be a great one. I'm always working to learn more about what I do and looking for ways to improve. I'm definitely not one of the best developers out there and likely never will be, but I'm on the path to mastery and I intend to be on it for a very long time.</p>

                <h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
                <p>I focus on writing code that works correctly, is reliable and is easy to maintain. I aim to build products that meet needs and are easy and enjoyable to use. Well-made software can do amazing things. Poorly made software can be a real pain. I work hard to consistently produce the well-made kind. I care a great deal about the quality of my work, and I take pride in it. I put a lot of effort into keeping my schedule, health and other factors in balance so that I can stay fresh and do my best work.</p>

                <h3>Joy</h3>
                <p>Ultimately, I choose to be a developer because I love doing it! I love writing code; I love creating beautiful, useful software. Building things with nothing more than a laptop and some know-how is a blast. I find joy in it, and I want the work I do to create joy in the lives of others as well.</p>

                <h3>Ruby</h3>
                <p>I fell in love with the Ruby language pretty quickly. I'm a
                huge fan of the elegance of the syntax and it's focus on
                programmer happiness. Writing Ruby feels natural and easy
                while still providing powerful tools and constructs. Most of the
                code I've written so far in my career has been Ruby.</p>

                </a>
                <h3>Rails</h3>
                <p>I think Rails is a fantastic framework for web development. I
                really appreciate the focus on convention over configuration and
                sensible defaults. It also pursues Ruby's goals of emphasizing programmer
                happiness and enabling beautiful code. I'm impressed by how
                productive I can be when I work with Rails. Even having been
                around as long as it has, I'm still excited by the progress and
                additions being made to the framework.</p>

                </a>
                <h3>Automated Testing</h3>
                <p>I'm a big believer in automated testing. Well tested code is
                easier to work with, easier to depend on and just makes for
                better software. I don't typically practice true TDD, but I
                write tests frequently as I write implementation code. I don't
                think of writing tests as only an investment in the future (though it
                certainly is that); I think writing tests improves the quality of
                your code and your software immediately, and there aren't very
                many cases where you wouldn't want to write tests.</p>

                </a>
                <h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
                <p>I really enjoy managing source code with Git. I think there's a lot of value in not only putting your code under source control, but in taking the time to do it well. I think a well-crafted Git history in a project can be a really valuable resource. It can be helpful to your team (or you) in the future and also improve the quality of your code as you're committing it. It's common for me to write lengthy commit messages and take the time to revise my Git history as I'm working on a project.</p>

                <p>I wouldn’t describe myself as a full-stack developer. I’ve done quite a bit of front-end development in the past and I can still do it if I need to, but it’s not my current area of expertise. I prefer back-end development and that’s what I’ve focused on for the last little while in my career. I enjoy back-end work more and I feel like I have more natural aptitude and value to contribute in that area.</p>

                <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
                <p>I’m conscious of basic performance requirements and pay attention to the performance of the code I write, but there haven’t been too many projects I’ve worked on thus far where performance was a high priority. I’m not the kind of guy who can eek out every drop of performance from an application. (If I was I probably wouldn’t be using Rails, right? <i class="far fa-grin-tears"></i> I kid, I kid. Rails is great.)</p>

                heavy computer science topics have never been terribly
                interesting to me. If something requires lots of math,
                sophisticated algorithms or other such things, I don't have a
                lot of supporting skills to offer.</p>

                <h3>Cloud Accounting</h3>
                <p><i>2019, Journal Technologies</i></p>
                <p>Cloud Accounting is an API only application that serves as a
                central storage location for all payment transactions from other
                applications in Journal Technologies' cloud suite.</p>
                <p>Prior to building Cloud Accounting, each individual
                application stored transaction information. By instead storing
                all transactions in a central place, we did complicate the
                implementation for the other applications in some ways because they now had
                an additional dependency to interact with, but we improved the
                security of the financial information and we made life easier
                for the people in accounting because they only had to go to one
                place when they needed any financial data.</p>
                <p>I was primarily responsible for building the application. I
                used Rails to build the REST API, and I used <a
                  href="https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation">rspec_api_documentation</a>
                to document it. I also built an admin
                interface using <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate">
                thoughtbot Administrate</a>. The API was secured using token based
                authentication and the admin interface was secured with <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>
                single sign-on.</p>

                <h3>Case Notifications</h3>
                <p><i>2018, Journal Technologies</i></p>
                <p>Case Notifications is an application that consumes event data
                from courts (a hearing was scheduled, a document was filed,
                etc.) and then summarizes and distributes that event data
                to subscribers through SMS and email notifications.</p>
                <p>I built a RESTful back-end using Rails which integrated with a
                React front-end. I also built a companion AWS Lambda function
                which notified the Case Notifications application when a new
                data file had been uploaded to AWS S3. I also built an admin
                interface using <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate">
                thoughtbot Administrate</a>. The user facing application was secured with
                <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, and the admin interface was
                secured with <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a> single sign-on.<p>
                <p>One of the interesting parts of this project for me was the
                performance optimization required. Some of the courts we
                expected to integrate with could have tens of thousands of events
                a day. I did work that optimized processing and
                importing these large data files which improved the import time for
                10,000 events from about 5 minutes to about 4 seconds.<p>

                professionals in California.</p>
                <p>I spent my time fixing bugs and adding
                small features. I also found and fixed a number of security
                vulnerabilities. Another teammate and I
                dramatically improved the test coverage of the application.</p>

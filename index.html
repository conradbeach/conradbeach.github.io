								<h3>Being Good</h3>
								<p>I care a lot about being a genuinely good person and treating peole right. I strive to be kind, generous and ethical in everything I do. I want to be the kind of person who's easy and enriching to work with, the kind of guy that you're really grateful to have on your team.</p>

								<h3>Doing Good</h3>
								<p>I'm passionate about doing work that makes a positive difference in the world. It doesn't need to be as glamorous as curing cancer or something like that, but it does need to be genuinely valuable. It needs to solve real problems and make people's lives better. Too many businesses, teams, etc. really only exist to make money; I think that's a shame, and I think we can do better.</p>

								<h3>Constant Improvement</h3>
								<p>I'm genuinely committed to the constant pursuit of mastering
                my field of work. I've chosen software development as my career, and I intend to become the best I possibly can at it. I don't want to be a halfway decent developer; I want to be a great one. I'm always working to learn more about what I do and looking for ways to improve. I'm definitely not one of the best developers out there and likely never will be, but I'm on the path to mastery and I intend to be on it for a very long time.</p>

								<h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
								<p>I focus on writing code that works correctly, is reliable and is easy to maintain. I aim to build products that meet needs and are easy and enjoyable to use. Well-made software can do amazing things. Poorly made software can be a real pain. I work hard to consistently produce the well-made kind. I care a great deal about the quality of my work, and I take pride in it. I put a lot of effort into keeping my schedule, health and other factors in balance so that I can stay fresh and do my best work.</p>

								<h3>Joy</h3>
								<p>Ultimately, I choose to be a developer because I love doing it! I love writing code; I love creating beautiful, useful software. Building things with nothing more than a laptop and some know-how is a blast. I find joy in it, and I want the work I do to create joy in the lives of others as well.</p>

						<h2>Things I Work With</h2>

						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

                <a class="image small" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">
                  <img src="images/ruby.png" alt="Ruby logo">
                </a>
								<h3>Ruby</h3>
								<p>I fell in love with the Ruby language pretty quickly. I'm a
                huge fan of the elegance of the syntax and it's focus on
                programmer happiness. Writing Ruby feels natural and easy
                while still providing powerful tools and constructs. Most of the
                code I've written so far in my career has been Ruby.</p>
							</section>

                <a class="image small" href="https://rubyonrails.org/">
                  <img src="images/ruby_on_rails.png" alt="Ruby on Rails logo">
                </a>
								<h3>Rails</h3>
								<p>I think Rails is a fantastic framework for web development. I
                really appreciate the focus on convention over configuration and
                sensible defaults. It also pursues Ruby's goals of ephasizing programmer
                happiness and enabling beautiful code. I'm impressed by how
                productive I can be when I work with Rails. Even having been
                around as long as it has, I'm still excited by the progress and
                additions being made to the framework.</p>

                  <img src="images/rspec.png" alt="RSpec logo">
                </a>
								<h3>Automated Testing</h3>
								<p>I'm a big believer in automated testing. Well tested code is
                easier to work with, easier to depend on and just makes for
                better software. I don't typically practice true TDD, but I
                write tests frequently as I write implementation code. I don't
                think of writing tests as only an investment in the future (though it
                certainly is that); I think writing tests improves the quality of
                your code and your software immediately, and there aren't very
                many cases where you wouldn't want to write tests.</p>

                  <img src="images/git.png" alt="Git logo">
                </a>
								<h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
								<p>I really enjoy managing source code with Git. I think there's a lot of value in not only putting your code under source control, but in taking the time to do it well. I think a well-crafted Git history in a project can be a really valuable resource. It can be helpful to your team (or you) in the future and also improve the quality of your code as you're committing it. It's common for me to write lengthy committ messages and take the time to revise my Git history as I'm working on a project.</p>

          <h3>Welcome To My Website: Learn How to Play Drums!</h3>
          <p>Hey everybody! This is Randall Beach, author and creator of learn-how-to-play-drums.com and DrummingExpert.com.</p>
          <p>I have a question for you.</p>
          <p>How do you take your drumming to the next level?  I mean really improve and make measurable progress towards becoming the drummer you want to be?</p>
          <p>We all have drummers that we look up to. We see them at concerts, in videos, listen to them in recordings. They most likely inspired us with the desire to learn how to play drums in the first place.</p>
          <p>What is it about these players, specifically, that make them so great? Why are THEY the ones setting the standards of drumming that inspire the rest of us? Why are they the ones making the recordings, selling the albums, and enjoying the rewards of performing at a world-class level?</p>
          <p>Famous, world-class drummers are great because they do certain things that make their playing refined, effortless, and superb.</p>

          <h3>We All Start Out Knowing Nothing!</h3>
          <p>I started out just like everyone else, knowing nothing! I fell in love with drumming, and I wanted more than anything to learn how to play drums. I finally got my first drum set and started "banging" around and having a good time. BUT somehow I knew there was so much more; I knew I was not very good.</p>

          <h3>A life-long Quest to Discover the Secrets of Drumming...</h3>
          <p>I have spent the last 37 years studying and searching to discover the "secrets" of world-class drummers.  I have been blessed to study with many great teachers. And over this long period of time have discovered and assembled the strategies and techniques that create this highest level of world-class playing. This process transformed me from nothing to a long professional drumming career that includes recording film and television scores in studios, playing many different kinds of music from Jazz, to Rock, to Country, and even playing with the World Championship Concord, CA Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps. Through all of this I have continued searching, studying and experimenting with everything I could learn. I have worked personally with HUNDREDS of students, experimenting, testing and finally put together a step-by-step process - a SYSTEM of drumming mastery -  that will put YOU on this same path of progress towards world-class drumming skills. </p>
          <p>So many of my students have been able to make dramatic progress in short periods of time and ultimately perform at the highest professional levels.</p>

          <h3>Don't Waste Another Minute Missing Your Drumming Potential</h3>
          <p>It is such a tragedy to see drummers wanting to succeed, but <span class="underlined">wasting years practicing incorrectly</span>. They are mediocre players - when they could easily be spectacular.</p>
          <p>Countless drummers have come to me after two or three years of playing the drums, sometimes much longer, who are making little progress and are playing FAR BELOW their potential. All because they have failed to learn the most fundamental secrets to great drumming.</p>

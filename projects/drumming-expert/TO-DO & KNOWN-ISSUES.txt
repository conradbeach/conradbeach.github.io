-Books-courses page needs more work on media queries. The picture of the book and headline next to it look poor at certain resolutions.

-Add a commenting system to the lesson pages.

-Add an about page that will serve as a resume of sorts to demonstrate dad's competence.

-Clarify what you get by signing up for his email feed.

-Make the bottom links that lead to the next lesson on the lesson pages look better.

-Consider creating a social media presence for Drumming Expert. At least Facebook.

-Pick whether the site will be DrummingExpert or Learn-to-Play-Drums. It shouldn't be both.

-Perhaps what could be given for signing up is to receive a link to download all of the lesson videos, a preview of the book and some other offerings. I don't think you should make seeing the videos on the page contingent on signing up.

-Add some product switch marketing lines, "Most sites that try to teach you how to play drums start out by teaching you how to play a basic beat on a kit. That may seem fun at first and it may feel pretty cool to start drumming right away, but it's not a good path to long term success. If you really want to learn how to play drums, you gotta start with the fundamentals. Fundamentals like how you hold the stick, how to develop a solid rythm and others. That's what I'm gonna teach you here on Drumming Expert."

-Make all the lesson videos freely available on Youtube. This is a great source of organic traffic. I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense to have them locked up.


**Dad's content owns anything else I've seen online. He's the best teacher I've seen (bias aside). However, the site isn't great. It's a bit of a turn off. Redesign it, and he could make some serious progress in the market.

          <h3>What others are saying about "Hold On To Your Stick!"</h3>
          <blockquote>"Let me begin by saying a big THANK YOU!!  Your free internet videos, combined with your book are a fantastic help.  My hands are improving daily, thanks to your instruction."<cite>Simon Timms,  Australia</cite></blockquote>
          <blockquote>"Randall Beach is one of the strongest educators in the world of percussion.  I had my very first lesson with him, and continued to study with him for 8 years.  He is capable of teaching students at every level.  The flawless fundamentals I learned from Randall allowed me to progress as a drummer without any bad habits that would have held me back.  He has a great way of positively motivating students to progress to the highest level possible.  I still consider Randall the most important music teacher I ever had." <cite>Greg Anderson - Former student, Professional Teacher and Percussionist. San Diego, CA</cite></blockquote>
          <blockquote>"....The method of technique and development shared in his new book has provided me with the knowledge and abilities necessary for achieving the highest level of drumming skill and mastery. Through application of these methods, I have received the highest ratings in state Solo &amp; Ensemble events for three years in a row, as well as first place in the rudimental snare-solo category at PAS (Percussive Arts Society) events. There is no "easy road" when it comes to achieving greatness in drumming, but there is definitely a right way to do it and this book will show you how..." <cite>Connor Runyan - Student, PAS State Rudimental Snare Drum Champion. Utah</cite></blockquote>
          <blockquote>“Randall Beach is the real deal. I started taking lessons from him when I was a rookie drummer. In just a few years, Randall had me flam dragging with him in the championship drum line of the 1985 Blue Devils. Randall has an inspiring ease that comes through in his playing and teaching--lightning fast, monster chops, combined with insightful, patient instruction. If you really aspire to take your drumming to the next level, Randall Beach is your guy!” <cite>David M. Pierson - Attorney, Former Member of Concord Blue Devils. Texas</cite></blockquote><br>

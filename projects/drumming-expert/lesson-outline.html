          <h3>Drumming is a "Mastery of Motions"</h3>
          <p>Drumming is a very physical activity and to succeed you must master the physical motions required. Much like, golf, tennis, or martial arts; there is a "vocabulary" of physical motions used to play drums. In drumming we call these "strokes."</p>
          <p>Each of the following lessons flow step by step through this "stroke vocabulary" that will help you develop incredible skills as a drummer.</p>
          <p>There are really only three basic rudiments in drumming:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Single Stroke Roll</li>
            <li>Double Stroke Roll</li>
            <li>Flams</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All other rudiments are combinations of these three "categories" of drumming. Yes, there are a few exception, but those are easy to deal with once you have mastered these three.</p>
          <p>The <strong>LESSON OUTLINE</strong> below lists all of the lessons available. You can access each lesson through the links below or through the left navigation bar on the home page.</p>

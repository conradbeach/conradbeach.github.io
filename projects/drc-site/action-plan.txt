Goal: Build a module that would demonstrate some of the basic purposes of the final application.

Steps / Ideas:
  -Start page has form to enter student's name and A#.
  -After student has logged in, they can see what tests they are scheduled for as well as request new test dates.

  -Alternatively, there will be a link which redirects to another page which allows staff to log in.
  -After staff logs in, they can pull up a query to show all upcoming test dates or the test dates for just one student.

This is probably sufficient to start. Develop an app that can do these things. Don't concern yourself with styling or other features.

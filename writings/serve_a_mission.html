            <p>Serving a mission is one of the most important things you will do
              in your life. It will bless you in so many ways and bless those
              you serve and teach.</p>

            <p>For young men, serving a mission is a priesthood obligation, a
              commandment from God. He expects every worthy, able young man to
              serve a mission.</p>

            <p>Here are just a couple of quotes from presidents of the church:</p>

            <p>Spencer W. Kimball said, "The question has been often asked, Is
              the mission program one of compulsion? And the answer, of course, is no.
              Everyone is given his free agency. The question is asked: Should
              every young man fill a mission? And the answer of the Church is
              yes, and the answer of the Lord is yes. Enlarging this answer we say:
              Certainly every male member of the Church <em>should</em> fill a mission,
              like he <em>should</em> pay his tithing, like he <em>should</em>
              attend his meetings, like he <em>should</em> keep his life clean and
              free from the ugliness of the world and plan a celestial marriage
              in the temple of the Lord." <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>Thomas S. Monson said, "[T]o young men of the Aaronic Priesthood
              and to you young men who are becoming elders: I repeat what
              prophets have long taught—that every worthy, able young man
              should prepare to serve a mission. Missionary service is a
              priesthood duty—an obligation the Lord expects of us who
              have been given so very much. Young men, I admonish you to prepare
              for service as a missionary. Keep yourselves clean and pure and
              worthy to represent the Lord." <sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>

            <p>As men, understanding our obligation to serve a mission is very
              important. And it means a lot to me personally because it’s the
              reason I served a mission. I really, really didn’t want to go on a
              mission. I was terrified. And the first part of my mission was very hard.
              But I went because I knew God expected me to. And I stayed because
              I knew God expected me to. And I’m incredibly grateful that I did.
              My mission was an amazing experience. I grew so much and became much
              stronger spiritually because of it. I helped people find the Gospel
              of Jesus Christ. I’m a much better man because I served a mission.
              It also ended up being a lot of fun. I have many good memories
              from that time and still have many good relationships that came from
              my time as a missionary.</p>

            <p>Gordon B. Hinckley offered this challenge, "I throw out a challenge
              to every young man within this vast congregation tonight. Prepare
              yourself now to be worthy to serve the Lord as a full-time missionary...
              [R]esolve within your hearts today to include in the program of your
              lives service in the harvest field of the Lord as a missionary of
              The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."
              <sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></p>

            <p>If you haven't thought much about a mission yet or you're not
              sure about serving a mission, I'd strongly encourage you to start
              thinking about it. If you don't yet have a testimony that God has
              commanded every worthy young man to serve a mission, I'd encourage
              you to pray about it. Ask Heavenly Father if the statements from
              these prophets are true and if He really does want you
              to serve a mission. Get a personal testimony of it. The sooner you
              decide to serve a mission, the more likely you are to actually go
              and the more prepared you'll be.</p>

            <p>I testify that serving a mission is incredibly important; it is a
              priesthood duty, and it will bless your life in amazing ways.</p>

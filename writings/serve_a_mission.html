            <p>Serving a mission is one of the most important things you will do
              in your life.</p>

            <p>It will bless you in so many ways and bless those you serve and teach.</p>

            <p>For young men, serving a mission is a priesthood obligation, a
              commandment from God. He expects every worthy, able young man to
              serve a mission.</p>

            <p>Here are just a couple of quotes from presidents of the church:</p>

            <p>Spencer W. Kimball said, "The question has been often asked, Is
              the mission program one of compulsion? And the answer, of course, is no.
              Everyone is given his free agency. The question is asked: Should
              every young man fill a mission? And the answer of the Church is
              yes, and the answer of the Lord is yes. Enlarging this answer we say:
              Certainly every male member of the Church <em>should</em> fill a mission,
              like he <em>should</em> pay his tithing, like he <em>should</em>
              attend his meetings, like he <em>should</em> keep his life clean and
              free from the ugliness of the world and plan a celestial marriage
              in the temple of the Lord." <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>Thomas S. Monson said, "[T]o young men of the Aaronic Priesthood
              and to you young men who are becoming elders: I repeat what
              prophets have long taught—that every worthy, able young man
              should prepare to serve a mission. Missionary service is a
              priesthood duty—an obligation the Lord expects of us who
              have been given so very much. Young men, I admonish you to prepare
              for service as a missionary. Keep yourselves clean and pure and
              worthy to represent the Lord."<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>

            <p>(TODO: Flesh this paragraph out more. Polish it.) Understanding the obligation to serve a mission is really
              important. And it means a lot to me personally because it’s the
              reason I served a mission. I really, really didn’t want to go on a
              mission. I was terrified. First part of my mission was very hard.
              But I went because I knew God expected me to. I’m very grateful
              that I served. My mission was an amazing experience. It was a lot
              of fun. I helped people find the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I’m a
              much better man because I served a mission.<p>

            <p>In 1789, in the first year of his presidency, George Washington
              issued a proclamation calling for a day of public thanksgiving and
              prayer.</p>

            <p>In part, it said, "Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to
              acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to
              be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection
              and favor… </p>

            <p>"Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of
              November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the
              service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent
              Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be—That we
              may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble
              thanks… for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable
              interpositions of his Providence…for the civil and religious
              liberty with which we are blessed; and the means we have of
              acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all
              the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer
              upon us. </p>

            <p>"And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our
              prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations
              and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions…
              and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal
              prosperity as he alone knows to be best." <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

            <p>Abraham Lincoln, in 1863 in the midst of the Civil War, also
              issued a thanksgiving day proclamation.</p>

            <p>He said, "The year that is drawing toward its close has been
              filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies.
              To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are
              prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been
              added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot
              fail to penetrate and even soften the heart which is habitually
              insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God."</p>

            <p>He then goes on to describe the many blessings the nation has
              enjoyed despite the trials of the Civil War.</p>

            <p>"No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked
              out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most
              High God, who while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath
              nevertheless remembered mercy.</p>

            <p>"It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly,
              reverently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one
              voice by the whole American people. I do, therefore, invite my
              fellow-citizens in every part of the United States… to set apart
              and observe the last Thursday of November next as a Day of
              Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in
              the heavens. And I recommend to them that, while offering up the
              ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and
              blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national
              perverseness and disobedience… fervently implore the interposition
              of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to
              restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes,
              to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility, and
              union." <sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>

            <p>I think these statements are beautiful. I love the principles and
              attitudes that both of these great men express. They teach the
              importance of thanking God. They both describe His mercy during
              difficult times. They both mention the need to repent.</p>

            <p>Both Abraham Lincoln and George Washington led this nation
              through very challenging times.</p>

            <p>I don't think our current situation rivals the difficulties of
              the American Revolution or the Civil War, but we certainly have
              challenges. A pandemic, a society that seems to be increasingly
              divided and angry, a decline in moral and religious
              principles.</p>

            <p>No matter the severity of our challenges, the principle of
              gratitude as these proclamations espoused can help guide us
              through difficult times.</p>

            <p>Washington and Lincoln show us that our gratitude should be
              directed towards God. Being generally grateful is a good thing,
              but even better is being grateful towards God.</p>

            <p>President Nelson, in his message to the world last week, invited
              us to do this. He invited us to identify the blessings we have in
              our life and express gratitude to God for them. And he promised
              powerful blessings would come as we did that. He promised healing
              would come. <sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></p>

            <p>We receive strength, protection and peace as we turn to our
              Father in Heaven. As we sincerely thank Him for the many blessings
              and mercies He extends to us, and as we repent and seek His pardon
              for our sins.</p>


            <h2>Blessings in My Life</h2>

            <p>I am incredibly grateful for the many blessings God has given me
              in my life. While there are many things I'm grateful for, the
              things I am most grateful for come from the gospel and from the
              Church. Being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ and being a
              participant in His gospel has impacted me and helped me in
              countless ways.</p>

            <p>As I contemplated the blessings I have personally received from
              my Father in Heaven, I identified three areas that mean the most
              to me.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Guidance</li>
              <li>Focus</li>
              <li>Joy and Peace</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Guidance</h2>
            <p>President Boyd K. Packer said, "If all you know is what you see
              with your natural eyes and hear with your natural ears, then you
              will not know very much". <sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></p>

            <p>Our vision as mortals is very limited. We just don't know that
              much. Our minds and spirits are incredible, but they are so
              limited in comparison to the knowledge and power of God. I'm very
              grateful that I have access to the knowledge and wisdom of the
              creator of the universe. It consistently helps me know and
              understand things I could never learn on my own.</p>

            <p>Additionally, there are many sophisticated, false philosophies in
              this world that Satan uses to distract and mislead people. The
              guidance of my Father in Heaven protects me from these false
              philosophies and beliefs.</p>

            <p>Doctrine and Covenants 82 gives a definition of
              commandments that I really like. It says, "And again, I say unto
              you, I give unto you a new commandment, that you may understand my
              will concerning you; Or, in other words, I give unto you
              directions how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for
              your salvation." <sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></p>

            <p>God's work and glory is to bring to pass our immortality and
              eternal life. That's his purpose. <sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>
              Everything he does, everything he asks us to do, is in pursuit of
              that goal. I'm grateful for the commandments Heavenly Father gives
              to us because they show me how to live a good life and avoid pain,
              difficulty and sorrow.</p>

            <p>I have confidence that I can and will receive guidance and
              direction from my Father in Heaven as I live righteously and seek
              His guidance. He helps me see what I should be doing in my life,
              and He gives me a much greater ability to discern truth.</p>

            <p>Personally, I am especially grateful for the gift of living
              prophets. I am so thankful for the leaders of this church, for the
              counsel, guidance and wisdom they give to us. To be led by
              prophets, seers and revelators that guide this church under the
              direction of Jesus Christ is an immense blessing.</p>

            <p>Following the words of the prophets has helped me avoid many
              mistakes in my life and find a great deal more success than I
              otherwise would have.</p>

            <p>I have come to really appreciate the gift of the Holy Ghost and
              the power it gives us. I learned this especially over the course
              of my mission. It's something my mission president taught us about
              often. Elder Lawrence E. Corbridge of the Seventy said, "Nothing
              in this life is of greater worth than the supernal gift of the
              Holy Ghost." <sup><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> I have a testimony
              of that statement.</p>

            <p>The Holy Ghost teaches us, sanctifies us and directs us.</p>

            <p>One thing I really appreciate about the Church is it puts me in a
              situation where I am constantly encouraged to be better and do
              better. And the Gift of the Holy Ghost and the atonement of Jesus
              Christ give me added power to do that.</p>

            <p>The sanctification that comes through the gift of the Holy Ghost
              allows me to change in ways that I could never do on my own.</p>


            <h2>Focus</h2>

            <p>In section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord
              instructs Emma Smith by saying, "And verily I say unto thee that
              thou shalt lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the
              things of a better." <sup><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> Certainly,
              that's God's invitation to all of us.</p>

            <p>The gospel and church of Christ bring simplicity and focus into
              my life. The gospel helps me focus on the things that actually
              matter and ignore or minimize the many, many things that
              don't.</p>

            <p>It helps me focus on the most important things such as family,
              helping others and becoming more like Jesus Christ. The gospel
              gives me a constant reminder that things like money, physical
              possessions and worldly success just don't matter eternally. </p>

            <p>The gospel helps me focus on building God's kingdom instead of my
              own. It helps me see just how much better my life is when I spend
              my time participating in God's mission instead of selfishly
              pursuing my own interests.</p>

            <p>I recently read a statement from President M. Russell Ballard
              that I really like. He said "Simplicity is powerful. Complexity is
              dangerous. I think Lucifer is the master of complexity and the
              Lord is the master of simplicity. The Gospel is simple and it is
              simply beautiful." <sup><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></p>

            <p>I am very grateful for that simplicity in my life. Being a
              follower of Jesus Christ removes a lot of complexity. The more
              closely I follow Him, the more I feel various burdens and concerns
              disappear.</p>


            <h2>Joy and Peace</h2>

            <p>Finally, I am grateful for the joy and peace that I have because
              of the church and gospel of Christ. I remember multiples times on
              my mission people asking me things like, "Elder Beach, why are you
              so happy?" "Elder Beach, why are you always smiling?" I was happy
              because of the things I knew from God about His plan and because I
              was doing what He wanted me to do by sharing that knowledge with
              others. I continue to receive joy as I choose to follow Him.</p>

            <p>The Book of Mormon teaches that "Men are that they might have
              joy". <sup><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> God's plan is the
              instruction manual for finding that joy.</p>

            <p>Because I'm a member of Christ's church and because I have
              accepted His gospel, I have a power to overcome difficulty and
              find joy in my life that I could never have on my own.</p>

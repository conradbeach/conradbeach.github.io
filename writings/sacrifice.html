            <p>Frequently, I think of sacrifice as enduring a painful or difficult burden.
            The saints crossing the plains and the like. Certainly some sacrifices are
            painful and difficult, but that's not actually the definition of sacrifice.
            Sacrifice is simply giving up something you want or have for a better cause.
            Many, likely most, of the sacrifices we make in this life are not going to be
            particularly demanding, challenging or painful. Most will be fairly simple; they
            won't be a matter of enduring some great trial, but simply placing the needs of
            God and others before your own. </p>

            <p>Sacrifice is choosing not to watch TV or do something on your phone so you
            can play a game with your kids. Sacrifice is serving in your church calling (as
            minor as it may be). These types of sacrifices won't hurt much, but they do
            require that you deny yourself.</p>

            <p>I think that's an important key to the principle of sacrifice (something we
            covenant to live when we receive our endowment); sacrifice is largely about your
            mind and heart. Do you consistently give up your desires and wants in order to
            accomplish something more meaningful. Something for God or other people around
            you. That's what sacrifice is really about, and most of the time, those
            sacrifices won't be large or impressive. But small, consistent sacrifice adds up
            to something large and impressive.</p>

            <p>As Brother Douglas D. Holmes said, "Holy and sacred places are built by
            sacrifice and consecrated effort;" <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

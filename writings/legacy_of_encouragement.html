            <p>Back in 2005, the well known historian David McCullough gave an
            address at BYU where he discussed different events from the
            American Revolution in the year 1776. He described the many
            defeats that the Continental Army experienced during that year,
            the harsh conditions of Valley Forge and the miraculous,
            successful battles at Trenton and Princeton near the end of 1776.
            By that point in time, George Washington's army had been reduced
            to only a few thousand men. And while the effect of their recent
            victories was substantial, the army and the cause of the
            Revolution weren't exactly in a great place. After describing
            these events, David McCullough told the following story.</p>

            <p>He said, "I want to share a scene that took place on the last day
            of the year of 1776, Dec. 31. All the enlistments for the entire
            army were up. Every soldier, because of the system at the time,
            was free to go home as of the first day of January 1777.
            Washington called a large part of the troops out into formation.
            He appeared in front of these ragged men on his horse, and he
            urged them to reenlist. He said that if they would sign up for
            another six months, he'd give them a bonus of 10 dollars. It was
            an enormous amount then because that's about what they were being
            paid for a month—if and when they could get paid. These were men
            who were desperate for pay of any kind. Their families were
            starving.</p>

            <p>"The drums rolled, and he asked those who would stay on to step
            forward. The drums kept rolling, and nobody stepped forward.
            Washington turned and rode away from them. Then he stopped, and he
            turned back and rode up to them again. This is what we know he
            said:</p>

            </p>" 'My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and
            more than could be reasonably expected, but your country is at
            stake, your wives, your houses, and all that you hold dear. You have
            worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how
            to spare you. If you will consent to stay one month longer, you will
            render that service to the cause of liberty, and to your country,
            which you can probably never do under any other circumstance.'</p>

            </p>"Again the drums rolled. This time the men began stepping
            forward. 'God Almighty,' wrote Nathanael Greene, 'inclined their
            hearts to listen to the proposal and they engaged anew.' "
            <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

            </p>I love that story. There's a lot of beautiful stories like that
            from the American Revolution. A lot of miracles.</p>

            </p>In the Doctrine and Covenants, we're taught that the Revolution
            was inspired and supported by God. <sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>
            He redeemed this promised land and established a free nation in preparation
            for the restoration of His gospel and His church. The struggle those
            men in this story were engaged in truly was the work of God. And their
            sacrifice has blessed countless people throughout the world. But at
            the time, how much of that could they have seen or known. And even
            if they could see it, how hard was that to remember while freezing
            and starving in Valley Forge or fighting a seemingly hopeless war
            against the most powerful military in the world. Without the
            encouragement of an inspired George Washington, it seems likely they
            would have abandoned the cause. Even with their recent successes,
            they didn't want to go on. But go on they did. Something we should
            be very grateful for.</p>

            </p>At least in some ways, I think our situation is not all that
            different from those men standing in front of Washington on a cold
            December day in 1776. We're also part of an eternally significant
            cause. Gathering Israel. Spreading the gospel. Preparing the world
            for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. President Nelson said, "[The
            gathering of Israel] is the most important thing taking place on
            earth today." <sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> But despite the
            importance and significance of what we're a part of, we may at times
            not want to continue. At times it will be challenging (we've been warned
            that the days ahead may make it very challenging). At other times we
            may just get distracted and lose focus of what's most important. But
            similar to what George Washington said, we have the opportunity to serve
            the work of God in a way we can probably never do under any other
            circumstance.</p>

            </p>And just like those soldiers in Washington's army, there may be
            times when the only thing that keeps us going is the support and
            encouragement of others. There may be times when the only thing that
            keeps someone else going is your support, encouragement and
            example.</p>

            </p>And of course, there are many who simply don't know the things
            we know who need to hear our testimonies and invitations so they
            have an opportunity to join this work as well.</p>
    
            </p>None of us can make it to where God wants us to go without His
            divine aid. We won't come through to the other side without the help
            of our Father in Heaven, without the guidance of the Holy Ghost, and
            without the redeeming and enabling power of the atonement of Jesus
            Christ.</p>

            </p>Jesus Christ said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but
            be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." <sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></p>

            </p>He said, "I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in
            me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me
            ye can do nothing." <sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></p>

            </p>It is through the power of Jesus Christ that we succeed in this
            life. Jesus Christ is the light and the life and the truth of the
            world. <sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> He is the light we hold up.
            His is the truth that we champion.</p>

            </p>It's essential that we hold fast to our Savior and do the things
            He's asked us to do. And it's essential that He be the source of
            power that we point others to.</p>

            </p>The world certainly doesn't make any of that easy. Lehi's vision
            of the tree of life seems more and more real to me. The great and
            spacious building with it's finery and mocking voices; the mists of
            darkness constantly working to blind and deceive. The world is full
            of deception, distraction and temptation. But when we build our
            foundation firmly on the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel, when we
            hold fast to the iron rod, we can be confident that the power of God
            will guide and deliver us.</p>

            </p>It's critical to remember that. And it's critical that we share
            that with others and help them remember it. In a world that's full
            of darkness and confusion, we can do so much to help each other find
            and hold on to the truth.</p>

            </p>And with so many opposing voices and philosophies, it's never
            been more important for us to hold up the truth of the gospel and
            the light of Jesus Christ.</p>

            </p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said,
            "Let us be articulate, for while our defense of the kingdom may not
            stir all hearers, the absence of thoughtful response may cause
            fledglings among the faithful to falter. What we assert may not be
            accepted, but unasserted convictions soon become deserted
            convictions." <sup><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></p>

            </p>And Brother Douglas D. Holmes of the Young Men General
            Presidency said, "[Y]ou must recognize that many of the popular,
            reasonable, and appealing philosophies of our day… simply don't
            withstand examination under the pure light of truth. Seeking, living
            by, and defending truth are absolutely critical to your spiritual
            and temporal survival. We cannot simply adopt, even unwittingly, the
            philosophies of men absent the light of revelation. I invite you to
            continue to be diligent seekers and defenders of truth."
            <sup><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></p>

            </p>One of the things that discourages me sometimes is how
            increasingly secular our society seems to be becoming. There are
            times and places where secular philosophies and scientific theories
            are fully accepted and discussed but religious thinking or
            principles are sidelined or outright disallowed. There's nothing
            inherently wrong, of course, with secular philosophies or scientific
            theories; there can be truth there too. But spiritual and religious
            truth ought to be valued and included in the conversation as well.
            And, in reality, given greater weight than those other worldly
            sources of knowledge.</p>

            </p>I'm personally very grateful for individuals who push back
            against this trend of secularism by openly expressing their faith.
            Sometimes, when I'm in these more secular environments, it can seem
            like the believers are the minority and that there's very few people
            left who have faith in God. That's simply not the case though. So
            it's very encouraging and reassuring to me when I see things like a
            coworker expressing their faith in God or offering to pray for a
            colleague. Or when someone in an otherwise non-religious article or
            video shares their simple testimony. I believe that's what Christ
            expects from us. He wants disciples who aren't afraid to show their
            faith and belief even in a society that is in many ways moving away
            from such things. He wants disciples who consistently say, "I
            believe." Disciples who consistently prioritize the things of God
            over the things of the world. And who trust the teachings of God
            over the teachings of the world. Despite the scoffing from the great
            and spacious building; despite the theories and philosophies of men
            that question or attack gospel truths, we the followers of Christ
            will courageously say, "We believe." I believe our willingness to do
            that will shine light into the hearts and minds of others. And it
            will lift and encourage fellow believers.</p>

            </p>Last month (Janauary 2023) in a Young Adult Face to Face, Elder
            Jeffrey R. Holland shared this counsel, "[W]e call you and every other
            young Latter-day Saint to be in the forefront of the moral force that
            can resolve these problems, that can turn back the tide of fear and
            pessimism and anxiety surrounding us. How important it is for you to
            pray not only for the Lord to prevail in your lives, as President
            Russell M. Nelson has asked, but also to pray that the values of
            your life will prevail with others who aren't quite so sure yet. If
            as individual disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ we were all more
            loving and peaceful and kind, if we would all try to keep the
            commandments of God as best we can, then we have every reason to
            feel confident about the world's condition and our own. Walking into
            the future this way, filled with peace and godly promise, we could
            have an absolutely stunning impact on the world. Abraham Lincoln
            said once that he tried to pluck a weed and plant a flower in its
            place every chance he got. If we all did that, our moral and
            spiritual deserts would be veritable gardens in no time… Refuse to
            accept the world for what it appears to be. Shine the brightness of
            your hope on it, and make it what it ought to be. Be that light
            Sister Holland has asked for you to be, a light never to be
            extinguished, the light of the Savior of the world."
            <sup><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></p>

            </p>We're not so powerless to impact this world as it may sometimes
            seem, at least as it sometimes seems to me. Despite the intensifying
            darkness, light, as it always does, will drive the darkness out. And
            despite the challenges we face, when we think of all that God and
            Jesus Christ have done for us and the many miracles They will do for
            us in the future <sup><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup>, we can be
            filled with hope. And eventually, hopefully soon, Jesus Christ will
            return and make all things right.</p>

            </p>I'll finish with another quote from Elder Neal A. Maxwell. He
            said, "How can we remain silent when we know that there will come a
            time, as the scriptures have foretold, when there will be a great
            sign in heaven and that all flesh shall see Christ together (See D&C
            88:93, D&C 101:23)? No wonder we rejoice! No wonder we reach out! No
            wonder we stand all amazed whenever the light of the everlasting
            gospel lights up a soul, denoting the dawn of a new discipleship...
            As the veil of unbelief thickens around the globe, nothing can rend
            'the dark veil of unbelief' (Alma 19:6) that is not sharp, piercing,
            bright, and true. Dull disciples will not light the way nor draw
            people to the kingdom. The philosophies of the world cannot do it...
            The truths we seek to live and to share are sweet, reassuring, and
            redeeming. But they are also tough truths; they keep us up against
            things that really matter. And central to all of these truths is the
            declaration of the Savior himself in which he said, 'Behold, . . . I
            am the light, and the life, and the truth of the world' (Ether
            4:12)." <sup><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></p>

            </p>I am eternally grateful for the blessing of being a member of
            the restored church and gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for
            the knowledge I have. It gives me direction, assurance and
            foundation. I know that Jesus Christ is the savior and redeemer of
            the world. I know this is His church. And I know He is coming back
            again. I pray that each of us may constantly strengthen our faith in
            these truths and find opportunities to help others do the same. I'm
            grateful that we get live on the earth right now; it's an amazing
            time to be here. Through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, we will
            see and accomplish incredible things.</p>

            <p>In the vision of the tree of life in 1 Nephi 8 in the Book of
            Mormon, Lehi says, "And it came to pass that I beheld others
            pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of
            the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of
            darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come
            forth and partake of the fruit of the tree. And after they had
            partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as
            if they were ashamed. And I also cast my eyes round about, and
            beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and
            spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above
            the earth. And it was filled with people, both old and young, both
            male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and
            they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers
            towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit. And
            after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of
            those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden
            paths and were lost." But others, despite the scorn and mocking from
            the great and spacious building, remained at the tree and “heeded
            them not”. <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

            <p>And in the new testament, in John chapter 6, we read about Jesus
            Christ teaching the people in the synagogue powerful doctrines
            related to His role as their savior. However, some responded with,
            "This is an hard saying; who can hear it?" "From that time many of
            his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. Then said
            Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? Then Simon Peter
            answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of
            eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ,
            the Son of the living God." <sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>

            <p>One of the reasons I find these accounts interesting is the
            contrast between the groups of people involved. In both cases, the
            individuals involved were seeing, hearing and experiencing similar
            things. But some chose to stay and some chose to leave.</p>

            <p>Each of us, as disciples of Christ, are choosing every day what
            kind of disciples we will be. Will we continue to be faithful, or
            will we wander away? Will we hold fast to what we know, or will we
            doubt?</p>

            <p>In General Conference last October (October 2022), one of the
            talks that stood out to me the most was <em>Are You Still Willing?</em>
            by Elder Kevin W. Pearson. <sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></p>

            <p>He begins by discussing the words of the sacrament prayers,
            specifically the line that says, "And witness unto thee, O God, the
            Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of
            thy Son…" He then focuses in on that word "willing".</p>

            <p>He says, "Willingness to focus on the Savior is so crucial it is
            the central message of the two most quoted scriptures in the Church:
            the sacrament prayers. Understanding the truth of what Heavenly
            Father so willingly offers each of us through His Only Begotten Son
            should evoke our utmost efforts to always be willing in return."</p>

            <p>Elder Pearson goes on, "If our spiritual foundation is shallow or
            superficial, we might be inclined to base our willingness on a
            social cost-benefit analysis or a personal inconvenience index. And
            if we embrace the narrative that the Church consists primarily of
            outdated or politically incorrect social policies, unrealistic
            personal restrictions, and time commitments, then our conclusions
            about willingness will be flawed. We should not expect the principle
            of willingness to trend positively with social media influencers or
            TikTok enthusiasts. The precepts of men rarely align with divine
            truth. The Church is a gathering place for imperfect individuals who
            love God and who are willing to follow the Lord Jesus Christ. That
            willingness is rooted in the reality that Jesus is the Christ, the
            Son of the living God. This divine truth can be known only by the
            power of the Holy Ghost. Therefore, our willingness is directly
            proportionate to the amount of time we commit to be in holy places
            where the influence of the Holy Ghost is present."</p>

            <p>This idea really struck me. That our willingness is directly
            proportionate to the amount of time we commit to be in holy places
            under the influence of the Holy Ghost. If we choose not to spend
            time under the influence of the Holy Ghost, we can’t expect to be
            willing to follow Christ.</p>

            <p>I can see the truth of this principle in my life though. When I
            spend consistent and meaningful time in the scriptures, in the
            temple, in service, I feel my spiritual convictions strengthened. I
            feel my desire and commitment to follow God increase.</p>

            <p>I remember a time earlier in my life when I was beginning to feel
            doubts about the prophet Joseph Smith because of all the worldly
            voices that try to tear him down. I asked my bishop for advice and
            he told me to just read the Book of Mormon; that was it. So I
            started to read the Book of Mormon every day, and I remember the
            Spirit strengthening my testimony and washing those doubts away. I
            am now much more willing to defend the prophetic call of Joseph
            Smith.</p>

            <p>If our willingness is proportionate to the time we spend in holy
            places with the Holy Ghost, how can we increase holiness in our
            life? How can we create more holy spaces?</p>

            <p>While it's essential to spend time in explicitly holy places such
            as the temple or the church, holiness certainly doesn't stop there.
            Home, work, school, the grocery store. These can all be holy places
            when we bring the companionship of the Holy Ghost with us, choose to
            act in holy ways and focus on holy things.</p>

            <p>Elder Lawrence E. Corbridge of the Seventy taught, "Nothing in
            this life is of greater worth than the supernal gift of the Holy
            Ghost… Every good thing depends on getting and keeping the power of
            the Holy Ghost in our lives. Everything depends on that."
            <sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> And as
            Elder Pearson is teaching us, continuing to be willing to follow the
            Lord Jesus Christ depends on it. It seems to me to be a pretty lousy
            trade to sacrifice the essential gift of the Holy Ghost for the
            trivialities and entertainments that the world offers. But how often
            do we do just that?</p>

            <p>Elder Pearson stated, "Far too many of us live in a virtual world
            awash in entertainment and messaging hostile to divine identity and
            belief in Christ."</p>

            <p>He says, "Are we willing to put forth more than a superficial
            effort into strengthening our faith in Christ? Heavenly Father loves
            us perfectly, but that love comes with great expectations. He
            expects us to willingly place the Savior at the very center of our
            lives."</p>

            <p>At baptism, we make covenants to follow Jesus Christ. Later, we
            go to the temple to receive the endowment where we make even more
            serious covenants to follow Him. There, we covenant to consecrate
            everything we have and are to God and to His work. Everything
            belongs to Him. Every moment is owed to Him. Talk about unrealistic
            time commitments. But it's not unrealistic. It's power. Being
            willing to give everything to God is the path to a joyful life.</p>

            <p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught, "Some see only sacrifice and
            limitations in obedience to the commandments of the new and
            everlasting covenant, but those who live the experience—who give
            themselves freely and unreservedly to the covenant life—find greater
            liberty and fulfillment. When we truly understand, we seek more
            commandments, not fewer. Each new law or commandment we learn and
            live is like one more rung or step on a ladder that enables us to
            climb higher and higher. Truly, the gospel life is the good
            life." <sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></p>

            <p>Elder Pearson agrees. He says, "Focusing on the Savior and our
            covenants brings lasting joy! The purpose of mortality is to prove
            our willingness. 'The great task of life [and the cost of
            discipleship] is to learn the will of the Lord and then to do it.'
            True discipleship leads to a fulness of joy. Are we willing to pay
            the price of discipleship?… Discipleship is not cheap, because the
            companionship of the Holy Ghost is priceless."</p>

            <p>It reminds me of that great quote from Thomas Paine: "Heaven
            knows how to put a proper price upon its goods…" <sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></p>

            <p>But it is, undoubtedly, a price well worth paying.</p>

            <p>Elder Pearson teaches, "Today, as in the times of Jesus, there
            will be those who will turn back, unwilling to accept the price of
            discipleship. As harsh and hateful criticism is increasingly leveled
            at the Savior's Church and those who follow Him, our discipleship
            will require a greater willingness to straighten and strengthen our
            spiritual spines and heed them not."</p>

            <p>The mocking taunts from the great and spacious building are only
            getting louder and more intense. We must be strong enough and
            willing enough to ignore those voices and instead focus on the voice
            of Jesus Christ, of our Father in Heaven and of the Holy Spirit. Our
            spiritual survival will depend on it.</p>

            <p>But along with the challenges of our day, we've been assured
            there will be many miracles. Our prophet, President Russell M.
            Nelson said in the April 2018 General Conference, "Our Savior and
            Redeemer, Jesus Christ, will perform some of His mightiest works
            between now and when He comes again. We will see miraculous
            indications that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, preside
            over this Church in majesty and glory." <sup><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></p>

            <p>And earlier this month in Conference (October 2022), he said, "my
            dear brothers and sisters, so many wonderful things are ahead. In
            coming days, we will see the greatest manifestations of the Savior’s
            power that the world has ever seen. Between now and the time He
            returns 'with power and great glory,' He will bestow countless
            privileges, blessings, and miracles upon the faithful." <sup><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></p>

            <p>These may be challenging times, but they will also be very
            exciting, inspiring and glorious if we we will stand in the right
            places and do the right things. If we will be the faithful that
            President Nelson is talking about.</p>

            <p>I know that we are children of loving heavenly parents. I know
            that Christ lives and that He is our savior. I know this is Christ's
            church and it is led by living prophets. I know that the Book of
            Mormon is the word of God. I have plenty of weaknesses and
            shortcomings, plenty of ways I wish I was better, but I know these
            things are true and I will <em>never</em> leave them. And I know that if I am
            willing to do that, Christ will make up for all my deficiencies and
            bring me home safe. I pray that we may all know these things,
            continue to know them and experience the joys that the gospel has to
            offer. Now and forever.</p>

            <p>In Mark chapter 9 in the New Testament, we find this story of
              Jesus Christ: "And one of the multitude answered and said, Master,
              I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit... And
              [Jesus] asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto
              him? And he said, Of a child. And ofttimes it hath cast him into
              the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst
              do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. Jesus said unto
              him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that
              believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and
              said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief." Jesus
              then cast the spirit out of the boy, and "took him by the hand,
              and lifted him up; and he arose." <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

            <p>Another story in John chapter 8, "And early in the morning
              [Jesus] came again into the temple, and all the people came unto
              him; and he sat down, and taught them. And the scribes and
              Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when
              they had set her in the midst, They say unto him, Master, this
              woman was taken in adultery... Now Moses in the law commanded us,
              that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?… [Jesus] said
              unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a
              stone at her... And they which heard it,... went out one by one...
              and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst...
              [He] said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no
              man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her,
              Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."
              <sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>

            <p>One final story in the book of 3 Nephi in the Book of Mormon,
              Christ had been with the Nephites teaching them and ministering to
              them. He then told them that His time was at hand, gave them a few
              final instructions and was about to leave. The Book of Mormon then
              says, "And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he
              cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they
              were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would
              ask him to tarry a little longer with them. And he said unto them:
              Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you. Have ye
              any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that
              are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are
              withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner?
              Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon
              you; my bowels are filled with mercy." He then proceeded to heal
              "every one" that was sick or afflicted. The scriptures go on, "And
              it came to pass that he commanded that their little children
              should be brought... and he took their little children, one by one,
              and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them. And when he
              had done this he wept again;" <sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></p>

            <p>The most important aspect of who Jesus Christ is is His role as
              our savior. That he performed the atonement and redeemed us. But I
              am also very grateful for the example He gives us of the
              attributes we should seek in our lives. I shared these stories of
              our Savior because they demonstrate the compassion that Jesus
              Christ has for us. And many other accounts could be shared from
              the scriptures. In these stories, we saw Christ show compassion in
              the face of limitations of faith, in the face of serious sin and
              in the face of mortal frailties and challenges. Christ offers
              compassion to all of God's children. He offers it to us
              individually.</p>

            <p>Additionally, Christ's compassion is patient and enduring. In
              Isaiah 54 He says, "with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on
              thee... For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed;
              but my kindness shall not depart from thee".
              <sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></p>

            <p>Jesus Christ loves us. He wants us to return home to live with
              Him and our Heavenly parents. And He is willing to patiently help
              us as we struggle along to get there.</p>

            <p>As Christ is compassionate and patient, so too we must be
              compassionate and patient with ourselves and with each other.</p>

            <p>President Russell M. Nelson said, "[B]rothers and sisters, let us
              do the best we can and try to improve each day. When our
              imperfections appear, we can keep trying to correct them. We can
              be more forgiving of flaws in ourselves and among those we love.
              We can be comforted and forbearing. The Lord taught, 'Ye are not
              able to abide the presence of God now ... ; wherefore, continue in
              patience until ye are perfected.' " <sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></p>

            <p>I believe that nowhere are these principles more important than
              with our families in our homes.</p>

            <p>The family is an essential part of God's plan of salvation for
              His children. Strong families make a huge difference in our
              ability to keep commandments, walk the covenant path and move
              towards perfection in the way President Nelson is describing.</p>

            <p>If we exercise patience with each other, our families and homes
              can become spiritual havens where we feel loved, valued and
              accepted despite our failings.</p>

            <p>This can, obviously, be hard to do sometimes. It can be easy to
              become frustrated and impatient. I we're not diligent, frustration
              or anger can bubble over and take control. I recall a time a few
              years back when our oldest son Aiden was about 4 and our daughter
              Teshia was about 2. Tabitha and I were in the living room
              together. There was a stick on the floor; more of a rod really. I
              think Aiden picked it up on a hike or something. Teshia walked in
              to the room, visibly upset. She saw the stick, picked it up and
              angrily said, "I will use this stick!". I jumped up and got in
              front of her asking, "For what?" "To hit Aiden!" I don't remember
              what she was upset about, but she was angry and blood was about to
              be spilt.</p>

            <p>I imagine most of us aren't going around whacking other people with
              sticks. But maybe in a moment of anger we say something we really
              shouldn't, or we do something that causes hurt.</p>

            <p>Criticism, harshness, anger, contention; these things drown out
              the voice and love of God in our homes. We already have too much
              of this in the world; we definitely don't need it in our homes. In
              our homes, patience and kindness should prevail. That will
              increase our ability to hear the voice of Jesus Christ and allow
              God to prevail more in our lives.</p>

            <p>Certainly we shouldn't water down God's standards or stop
              encouraging each other to do our best. God is certainly never
              casual about covenants or commandments. But He is also so
              merciful. Personal change can be hard and often takes time. We can
              strive to remember that, extend compassionate patience to each
              other and be willing to wait as growth and change happen.</p>

            <p>My wife can tell you that I've grown a lot over the course of
              our marriage. There are certain areas where I've made a great deal
              of progress. On the other hand, there are areas where progress has
              been much slower. There are weaknesses that she had to tolerate
              when we got married and she continues to have to tolerate. I'm
              grateful for her patience with me and her willingness to continue
              to endure and wait as I keep trying. She will undoubtedly need
              that patience moving forward. I have a long way to go.</p>

            <p>And we all do. We all have a long way to go before we achieve
              the perfection that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have planned
              for us.</p>

            <p>In Alma 32, <sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> Alma compares the word to a seed. He teaches that we
              must patiently nourish the seed as it grows into a tree before it
              bears fruit. I imagine God sees us in a similar way. (The allegory
              of the olive vineyard in Jacob 5 seems to suggest so.) We may just
              be seeds or saplings right now, but He's willing to nourish us and
              wait for us to grow and bear fruit. We can do the same for each
              other.</p>

            <p>As with many things, I believe it's Christ-like love that drives
              our ability to be patient and kind.</p>

            <p>I served my mission in Detroit, Michigan. Such an amazing
              experience being a missionary. One of the most impactful
              experiences of my mission was the love I felt for the people I
              worked with. I interacted with a lot of people as you can imagine,
              and many of those people were living lives that in meaningful ways
              could not be described as godly or in harmony with God's laws.
              Despite that, most of the time it was easy to not be harsh or
              critical towards them. I mostly just felt love. I wanted them to
              see the truth of the gospel, to help them repent and to feel the
              joy I felt in my life from following Jesus Christ and keeping His
              commandments. I firmly believe that love I felt was a gift from
              God. And it was powerful. It changed how I viewed and treated
              people.</p>

            <p>Mosiah 18:21 says, "And he commanded them that there should be no
              contention one with another, but that they should look forward
              with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their
              hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards
              another."</p>

            <p>Patience and compassion allows us to hear and feel God's love in
              our lives. It connects us to Christ and allows us to see ourselves
              and others more like how He sees us. I have felt this many times
              with my children. When I let go of frustration or irritation that
              I'm feeling, I'm often filled with love for them and I see them as
              the beautiful, eternal children of God that they are. Imperfect as
              they may be. </p>

            <p>We all need grace. We all need mercy. When we mercifully offer
              patience and compassion to all of God's children (ourselves
              included), God's plan of redemption comes into clearer focus. We
              see better why we're all here and what our purpose is on this
              earth. We're more likely to experience that unity described in
              Mosiah 18.</p>

            <p>I hope each of us can hear Christ's voice of patience and
              compassion in our lives and that we echo that voice to those
              around us, especially in our homes.</p>

            <p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said, "I testify that in this and every
              hour He is, with nail-scarred hands, extending to us that same
              grace, holding on to us and encouraging us, refusing to let us go
              until we are safely home in the embrace of Heavenly Parents. For
              such a perfect moment, I continue to strive, however clumsily. For
              such a perfect gift, I continue to give thanks, however
              inadequately." (Jeffrey R. Holland, Be Ye Therefore
              Perfect—Eventually, October 2017 General Conference)</p>

            <p>I pray that each of us may do the same. In the name of Jesus
              Christ, amen.</p>

            <p>In December of 1777, George Washington marched into Valley Forge
            with around 15,000 already hungry and ragged troops. They would
            endure the winter there and, by the end, about 2,500 of them would
            die from disease, exposure and starvation.</p>

            <p>George Washington said of this experience, "There comes a
            soldier, his bare feet are seen through his worn out shoes, his
            legs nearly naked from the tattered remains of an only pair of
            stockings; his breeches are not sufficient to cover his nakedness,
            his shirt hanging in strings, his hair dishevelled, his face
            meagre. He comes and cries with an air of wretchedness and
            despair, "I am sick, my feet lame, my legs are sore, my body
            covered with this tormenting itch…" <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

            <p>The historian Brent Degraff said, "With no support from Congress,
            and with little food, ammunition, or clothing for the men, the
            situation was beyond desperate; it was all but lost. Sickness and
            disease from bad weather and pathetic living conditions caused
            suffering and death among the soldiers. Typhoid, typhus,
            dysentery, and pneumonia killed nearly 2,000 men during the winter
            of 1777-78. The situation was overwhelming for even Washington
            himself. He expressed the following emotions in April of 1778:
            'For seven days past, there has been little less than a famine in
            camp. A part of the army has been a week without any kind of
            flesh, and the rest three or four days. Naked and starving as they
            are, we cannot enough admire the incomparable patience and
            fidelity of the soldiery…'</p>

            <p>"Many times, in a moment of crisis, men will stand and
            passionately declare their allegiance to a cause or to their
            country. But a patriot's true loyalty is shown during times such
            as those at Valley Forge when the cheering crowds are gone and the
            reality of cold and hunger tests the very soul of a man's
            commitment. Thomas Paine said it best in 'The American Crisis,'
            written during the darkest period of the Revolutionary War: 'These
            are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the
            sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of
            their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and
            thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily
            conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder
            the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.' " <sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>

            <p>Thomas Paine also wrote, "What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too
            lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.
            Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods." <sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></p>

            <p>Along with the events at Valley Forge, there are many other
            stories of sacrifice from the founding generation of our nation.
            They paid a very high price to establish a free nation. Through
            commitment to a just cause and the grace of God, the founders
            succeeded in their struggle, bringing about God's purposes.</p>

            <p>I see a lot of parallels between the story of the revolution and
            the role the gospel of Jesus Christ plays in each of our lives. I
            believe, in large part, it was the founders' commitment to what
            they were doing that allowed God to work miracles on their behalf.</p>

            <p>It is this kind of determination and commitment that I want to
            speak about. Not commitment to peace or political freedom, as
            important as those are, but commitment to following Jesus Christ
            and to being His disciples. To be "not ashamed of the gospel of
            Christ" <sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>. To truly understand
            what it means to follow our Savior and do His will. No matter the
            difficulty, and no matter the cost.</p>


            <h2>The Commitment Christ Asks of Us</h2>

            <p>In Luke 9, Christ says, "And he said to them all, If any man will
            come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily,
            and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but
            whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save
            it." <sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></p>

            <p>Later in that same chapter of Luke, Christ says, "No man, having
            put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the
            kingdom of God." <sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></p>

            <p>The total commitment Christ requires of us is not arbitrary. He
            asks it of us because He knows that it is the only way we can
            experience every blessing He has for us. We must be wholly,
            completely invested in Christ's gospel if we are to become like
            Him and inherit His father's kingdom.</p>

            <p>Joseph Smith said, "[A] religion that does not require the
            sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the
            faith necessary unto life and salvation." <sup><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></p>

            <p>I think commitment and sacrifice is a pattern we see all
            throughout the gospel, in ordinances, in the temple. Christ wants
            each of us to turn over our lives to Him, and then He can turn us
            into something truly great.</p>

            <p>Turning our lives over to Christ comes with some amount of pain
            and discomfort, it's not always easy, but it's absolutely the best
            way to live. It's the only way to truly be happy.</p>


            <h2>The Cost of Discipleship</h2>

            <p>There are certainly going to be times when there will be a high
            cost associated with being a disciple of Christ though. It won't
            always be easy to follow our Savior.</p>

            <p>We have many examples in scripture and in Church history. Joseph
            and Hyrum gave their lives as martyrs. The Pioneers crossed the
            plains. The Stripling Warriors risked their lives and joined the
            fight to protect their families and country. Christ's apostles
            left their nets and everything else to follow Him.</p>

            <p>Paul is another example. After repenting and being converted, he
            dedicated his life to preaching the gospel. In 2 Timothy we
            read, "But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the
            work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. For I am
            now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
            I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
            the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
            righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me
            at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love
            his appearing." <sup><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></p>

            <p>We have to be willing to pay the price of following Christ. And
            if we do, we will be richly blessed. Now and in eternity.</p>

            <p>On my mission, I had the chance to learn and see firsthand how
            essential it is to give everything we have to remain faithful. As
            I'm sure others who have served missions can attest, it's a
            wonderful, happy experience to see someone learn about the Church
            and the gospel, feel the Spirit testify to their hearts that it's
            true and then watch that individual choose to make covenants with
            their Heavenly Father and be baptized. It's always a powerful
            experience. When they do this, they see many blessings come into
            their life. However, they also frequently see challenges, both
            before and after baptism. Satan and the world work very hard to
            drive people away from truth. On my mission, I saw multiple
            people, after having felt the truth of the gospel and being
            baptized, fall prey to temptation or trial and ultimately fall
            away from the Church. Blessings that could have been theirs were
            lost. Each of us are making similar decisions in our lives,
            probably in smaller ways, but the same decision nonetheless. Are
            we going to have the courage and faith to do what Christ has asked
            us to or not? Will we stand up and honor our covenants? Will we
            keep the commandments as best we know how, or will we come up with
            some excuses, take the more convenient path and fail to do what we
            know we should? In many ways, this is the meaning of a true
            disciple to me. Someone who knows the Lord enough and has faith
            and courage enough to stand on the Lord's side no matter what.
            Someone who, through the power of the Holy Ghost, puts aside the
            natural man or woman and chooses to act and become like Christ.</p>

            <p>How sad it is for one of God's children to give up all the
            celestial blessings God has to offer simply because they weren't
            ready to pay the price to receive them, or because they chose to
            follow after the world's ways.</p>

            <p>And which way, really, is easier in the end? Sure, the world's
            ways may seem easier on the surface, but they inevitably lead to
            greater sorrow and loss.</p>

            <p>Follow the Lord's path. That's where real satisfaction and joy
            lies. The happiness of the world, just like the foundation of the
            great and spacious building, is an illusion. There is no long term
            fulfillment to be had there. That can only be found by following
            the Lord.</p>

            <p>Despite the cost associated with doing things God's way, it's
            always the better path.</p>

            <p>Melvin J. Ballard said, "A person cannot give a crust to the Lord
            without receiving a loaf in return." <sup><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></p>

            <p>So give that crust. Do what we're asked to. Whether it's having
            family home evening, fulfilling our ministering assignments, or
            something more difficult. If we keep the commandments and stick to
            the gospel even when we experience trials and difficulties, the
            reward from heaven will more than make up for the cost. We and our
            families will be infinitely better off.</p>

            <p>This is how the gospel works. Through sacrifice. Through
            commitment. And, of course, our Master, He who atoned for our
            sins, is no stranger to sacrifice. He isn't asking us to do
            anything He hasn't already done.</p>


            <h2>Discipleship Today</h2>

            <p>In the April 2009 General Conference, President Dieter F.
            Uchtdorf said this, "It is not enough merely to speak of Jesus
            Christ or proclaim that we are His disciples. It is not enough to
            surround ourselves with symbols of our religion. Discipleship is
            not a spectator sport. We cannot expect to experience the
            blessings of faith by standing inactive on the sidelines any more
            than we can experience the benefits of health by sitting on a sofa
            watching sporting events on television and giving advice to the
            athletes. And yet for some, 'spectator discipleship' is a
            preferred if not a primary way of worshipping. Ours is not a
            secondhand religion. We cannot receive the blessings of the gospel
            merely by observing the good that others do. We need to get off
            the sidelines and practice what we preach." <sup><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></p>

            <p>No matter our situation, as true disciples, we need to get out
            there and defend the gospel of Christ.</p>

            <p>We know that wickedness will grow in these last days, and I
            firmly believe the Lord expects each of us to make sure that
            wickedness doesn't go unchallenged or uncontested.</p>

            <p>While wickedness in many ways is growing, it's also easy to see
            in just how many ways God's work is progressing. There are more
            missionaries than ever. The Church is larger and more broadly
            spread than ever. God's work moves forward, and we can make a
            difference and be part of that progress.</p>

            <p>In the world today, one of the most valuable ways, I believe, we
            can defend true principles as disciples of Christ is in the area
            of family.</p>

            <p>Bruce C. Hafen discusses some of the ways that our culture, and
            others throughout the world, have shifted away from principles God
            has given us. Principles such as commitment to marriage,
            parenthood and raising children in a stable family environment
            with a mom and a dad. He then shares some of the ways our society
            has been negatively impacted by these shifts. He says, "Now
            consider the effect of these changes on marriage and children.
            Since about 1965 the U.S. divorce rate has more than doubled,
            although it has dipped slightly in recent years—partly because the
            number of unmarried couples has increased by about 15 times, and
            their frequent breakups aren't included in the divorce rate. Today
            about half of all first marriages end in divorce; about 60 percent
            of second marriages do. The United States is the world's most
            divorce-prone country. Today 40 percent of U.S. births are to
            unmarried parents. In 1960 that number was 5 percent. About 50
            percent of today's teens now consider out-of-wedlock childbearing
            a 'worthwhile lifestyle.' The percentage of children in
            single-parent families since 1960 has increased fourfold, from 8
            percent to 31 percent. Over half of today's U.S. marriages are
            preceded by unmarried cohabitation. What was highly abnormal in
            the 1960s is the new normal." <sup><a href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></p>

            <p>Russell M. Nelson said this about traditional marriage, "The
            greatest guardians of all virtues are marriage and family. This is
            particularly the case with the virtues of chastity and fidelity,
            both of which are required to create enduring and fully rewarding
            marriage partnerships and family relationships. Male and female
            are created for what they can do and become—together. It takes a
            man and a woman to bring a child into the world. Mothers and
            fathers are not interchangeable. Men and women are distinct and
            complementary. Children deserve a chance to grow up with both a
            mom and a dad. You will likely encounter increasing debate about
            the definition of marriage. Many of your neighbors, colleagues,
            and friends will have never heard logical and inspired truths
            about the importance of marriage as God Himself defined it."
            <sup><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></p>

            <p>Clearly, age old, divine principles given to us by God concerning
            chastity, fidelity and family are crumbling in our society. The
            loss of those principles is having a heavy negative impact, and
            that impact will only grow as society's failure to keep God's
            commandments grows.</p>

            <p>Concerning our responsibility in this matter, President Nelson
            said this, "The day is gone when you can be a quiet and
            comfortable Christian. Your religion is not just about showing up
            for church on Sunday. It is about showing up as a true disciple
            from Sunday morning through Saturday night—24/7! There is no such
            thing as a part-time disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus
            invites anyone who wants to be His disciple to take up his cross
            and follow Him. Are you ready to join the ranks? Or will you be
            ashamed of the gospel? Will you be ashamed of your Lord and His
            plan? Will you yield to voices of those who would have you join
            them on the popular side of contemporary history? No! The youth of
            Zion will not falter! I believe you will be courageous and
            proclaim God's truth with clarity and kindness, even when His
            truth is politically unpopular! Paul set that pattern when he
            declared, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
            power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth".
            Disciples of the Lord are defenders of traditional marriage. We
            cannot yield. History is not our judge. A secular society is not
            our judge. God is our judge! For each of us, Judgment Day will be
            held in God's own way and time." <sup><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></p>

            <p>There is much that we can do to defend the divine institution of
            the family. Marriage and family are possibly the most important
            principles of the gospel that we can defend today, but they
            certainly aren't the only thing. They're just one example. There
            are so many ways that we can be a light on a hill, that we can
            stand for truth.</p>

            <p>I believe that our success in changing society or the world is
            not the most important consideration. Certainly we try to affect
            the most good that we can, but, ultimately, our primary concern is
            to fulfill our duty to God. If we do that, then we can be
            confident in our personal worthiness and cleanliness. And we can
            trust God to work out the rest.</p>


            <h2>Commitment Comes Through Faith and Understanding Doctrine</h2>

            <p>I strongly believe the only way we'll have the strength the make
            the sacrifices that Christ asks of us is if we have firm
            testimonies of the gospel. When things get challenging, when we
            lack motivation, it is our understanding and testimony of the
            gospel that will carry us through.</p>

            <p>President Boyd K. Packer said, "True doctrine, understood,
            changes attitudes and behavior." <sup><a href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></p>

            <p>Our ability to follow Christ, keep His commandments and be true
            disciples will depend in large part, I believe, on how well we
            understand, believe and trust His word. Jeremiah said that "his
            word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones… and
            I could not stay." <sup><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></p>

            <p>When we believe like that, when the word of God burns in our
            hearts, we can do great things. That belief and trust is gained
            through study and the Holy Ghost. It's maintained by the same. And
            when we read His word, we see that He will be with us every step
            of the way to strengthen and support us.</p>

            <p>Christ asks and expects much of us, His disciples, but He doesn't
            expect us to get there all at once. He doesn't expect us to
            achieve perfection today or tomorrow. He does expect a willing
            heart and mind and for us to start working and moving forward from
            where we're at. When we do that, His grace and mercy will help and
            sustain us during our journey of discipleship.</p>


            <h2>Courage</h2>

            <p>John 6 in the New Testament contains a powerful account of
            dedication to the Savior. After teaching doctrine about being the
            bread of life and that all men must believe in Him and come unto
            Him, some felt that what Christ taught was too challenging.</p>

            <p>Starting in verse 60, it says, "Many therefore of his disciples,
            when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can
            hear it? ...From that time many of his disciples went back, and
            walked no more with him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye
            also go away? Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall
            we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are
            sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God."
            <sup><a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></p>

            <p>May we have the same conviction as that of Peter. That Jesus is
            the Christ, that this is His church and that the gospel is the
            good word sent down from heaven. May we have that kind of faith,
            dedication and courage. And may that conviction drive us to
            courageously stand up as true disciples of the Master. To not be
            ashamed of the gospel of Christ. And to spread and defend it in
            any way that we can.</p>

            <p>As President Thomas S. Monson has said, "Let us—all of us—have
            the courage to defy the consensus, the courage to stand for
            principle. Courage, not compromise, brings the smile of God's
            approval." <sup><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></p>

            <p>I testify that Christ is the Lord. This is His gospel, and it is
            the way, the only way, to happiness and eternal life. May we have
            the faith to follow Him.</p>

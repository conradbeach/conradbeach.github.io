      <h3>I Really Do Love to Code</h3>
      <p>I've always had a love for computers. Growing up, I spent a lot of time on them. I had my first exposure to coding when I was in highschool. I learned some HTML and built a small site with a couple of pages about me and things I liked. I'm pretty sure the design wasn't very good and the code was pretty poor (tables for layout anyone?), but I remember having a lot of fun. A little later, a friend and I built another website with a few self-written articles about current events for a school project and had it published to the web. It was a lot of fun to see some of our own work online.</p>
      <p>When considering a career, becoming a developer of some sort seemed like a pretty good choice. I started attending Utah State University majoring in computer science with an emphasis in software development. I enjoyed school. My classes were typically pretty interesting, and I had good professors. However, I wasn't satisified. I wasn't attending a university because I thought it would give me the best education. I was attending a university because I felt like I needed that ever so important degree if I wanted a good job. I attended Utah State for about a semester and a half (taking two years off to serve a mission for my church), but ultimately I felt like there were better ways to learn the skills of a good developer. After a lot of thought and research, I concluded the best choice was for me to leave college and pursue an alternative education.</p>

      <p>It was definitely one of the best choices I've made.</p>

      <p>As I've learned more about the web development industry, I've come to the conclusion that college can be a good way to get an education, but it's definitely not the only way. A degree can be valuable, but it's not essential. The most important thing is having the skills and knowledge that allows you to bring value to other people. If you've got that, you're good to go. I'm not really concerned about not having a formal degree. I just want to learn as much as possible, become a great developer and build something sweet.</p>

      <h3>My Goal</h3>
      <p>Right now, I'm learning as much I can about web development. I spent a couple of months learning the basics of front-end development. I learned about principles of good web design and learned to use HTML5 and CSS3. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I feel like the back-end is where I really want to be. That's what I'm learning right now. PHP, Ruby, Python. I've learned a little about each, and I want to keep learning. I think I'm most excited about Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I love the web. I love the power, connectivity and information it provides. I would love nothing more than to start working for a high quality web development firm building awesome applications and sites. The web is already an amazing place. I genuinely want to be a part of making it better.</p>

      <em><br>As a side note, when I'm not coding, I love reading, being outdoors and hanging out with my wife.</em>

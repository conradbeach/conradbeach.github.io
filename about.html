      <h3>A long time ago...</h3>
      <p>I've always had a love for computers. Growing up, I spent a lot of time on them. I had my first exposure to coding when I decided I wanted to learn how to write HTML and make webpages. I found some tutorials online and started trying things out. After I picked up a bit, I created a personal web page with some information and picures about me and things I liked. I'm sure the code was sloppy and the design pretty weak, but I had fun building it. The next project I got involved in was building a website with my best friend (who was also trying his hand at HTML along with some PHP). We built a simple website for a school project. It included a few articles we had written about current events that were important to us. My friend published it to the web with his dad's web hosting provider. It was pretty cool to see some of our own work up on the internet.</p>
      <h3>Education...</h3>
      <p>Back in 2010, I started attending Utah State University. I majored in computer science with an emphasis in software development. My comp sci classes were interesting and my professors were pretty good, but I didn't feel like I was learning as quickly and as well as I could be. My main reason for attending a university was not because I thought it would provide the best education but because I thought having a degree was a requirement for a successful career. I continued to attend Utah State for a couple of semesters (taking 2 years off to serve a mission for my church) but I kept researching the software development industry and started to question if I really did <em>need</em> a degree. As I learned more, I concluded that it was not the case that a degree was a necessity. Furthermore, there were so many high quality resources for learning the skills I would need in my profession that I was confident I would have no trouble finding the educational resources I would need. Near the end of 2013, after a lot of thought, I decided to drop out of college and puruse my education through less conventional means. More than a few people thought I was making a bad choice (especially considering I had a full four year scholarship) and tried to talk me out of leaving. Still, I was convinced that it was the best choice. Several months later, I'm now even more convinced. </p>
      <h3>Right now...</h3>
      <p>Right now, I'm learning more and more about web development. Mostly, I'm using courses from Treehouse and Code School along with an occasional course from edX or Coursera. I've learned some HTML, CSS and a little PHP. I'm really looking forward to learning more about other programming languages for the web such as JavaScript and Ruby. I've become a strong believer in the power of finding an education in whatever way works best for you. There are a lot of effective ways (and many ineffective ways as well) to gain knowledge and learn skills. I want to find ways to help push along the movement of alternative education that will hopefully keep growing. And I want to be able to write the software for the web that is helping to make it possible.</p>
      <p>I love the entire realm of the web. I love the power, connectivity and information it provides. My dream is to be in a career building high quality web pages and applications for sweet organizations furthering causes I'm passionate about. </p>
      <p><br>As a side note, when I'm not coding, I love reading, being outdoors and hanging out with my wife.</p>
